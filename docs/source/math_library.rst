Math Library
===========

The Math library is used for mathmatical functions, this includes basic
addition, subtraction, ect., and more complex methods such as fibinocci sequences
or powers. This is a builtin library included with the compiler and can be used
by any Aurora program.

The following are the functions of the library and a description of how to use them.
Add
~~~~~

Syntax
^^^^^^

``add>number, number2;``

Usage
^^^^^

Add will add the two numbers in the input and then return the result. The returned result
is in the Aurora number variable format.
Subtract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Syntax
^^^^^^

``sub>number, number2;``

Usage
^^^^^

Much like Add, Subtract will subtract the second number from the first number, so ``number - number2``.
The returned result is also in the Aurora number variable format.

Multiply
~~~~~

Syntax
^^^^^^

``mul>number, number2;``

Usage
^^^^^

Multiply will multiply the two numbers and then return a number in the Aurora number variable format.
Divide
~~~~~

Syntax
^^^^^^

``div>number, number2;``

Usage
^^^^^

Divide will divide the first number by the second number and then return a number
in the Aurora number variable format.

Power
~~~~~

Syntax
^^^^^^

``pow>number, number2;``

Usage
^^^^^

Power will multiply the first number by the itself x times, where x is number2.
Then return a number in the Aurora number variable format.

Absolute Value
~~~~~

Syntax
^^^^^^

``abs>number;``

Usage
^^^^^
Absolute Value will return the inputed number with a positive, so if it's a negitive number then
it's positive, if it's a positive number then it's positive. The returned number is also in the Aurora
number variable format.
