### Definitions

The basis of all programming languages is definitions and math.
To define a variable in Aurora is simple.
You must know the *type*, the *name*, and a *value*.
Definition is then as follows.

`[Type]: [Name] = [Value]`

There are many types, and one can also create their own variable type.
Names consist of standard ASCII characters, underscores, and digits;
a name must also not start with a digit (number).
A value is contricted to that variable's type.
For example if a variable's type is `Number` then it must be an integer or float (a number).
If the type is `String` then the value must be an array of characters defined by `"[Value]"`.
Notice the double quotation marks on either side of the value.

A list of types with their expected values can be found on the [Types page.](http://auroracompiler.rtfd.io/en/latest/types)

### Math

The other basic of programming languages is math.
Basic level math consists of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, grouping, and order of operations.
