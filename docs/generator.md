# Generator

### What does this do?

The Generator is the next, and last step of the compiler.
It creates Python code based on the AST that the parser generates.
This is probably one of the most simple steps and won't require as much work to implement.

### Timeline?

* **Day 1:** From the example ASTs created when developing the parser, create generated code.
* **Day 2:** Write the pseudo for the generator, and then implement it in Python.
* **Day 3:** Finish up Python code, and polish.
