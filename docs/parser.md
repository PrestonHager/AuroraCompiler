# Parser

### What does this do?

The Parser takes the array (list) of tokens generated by the Lexer and turns it into an Abtract Syntax Tree (AST).
An AST is a visual representation of how code generation might be completed.
This means it takes the ordered list of tokens and turns it into something a Generator can understand and create code out of.

### Timeline?

* **Day 1:** Create 1-2 example ASTs and companion code. Then write psuedo code for how it might execute.
* **Day 2:** Finish up the psuedo code. Then start on writing actual Python code.
* **Day 3:** Complete actual Python code, and then polish and squash those bugs!
